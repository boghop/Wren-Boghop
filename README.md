# Wren-Boghop

### September 2017 update

In August 2017, I moved the content from boghop.com to yet another new and hopefully final home for all of my content, which is sawv.org. I'm not using this repo to host the Wren code that manages sawv.org. That code exists in a repo at my main GitHub account. I'll probably use this GitHub account only for IndieAuth logins. I'm hosting sawv.org at Digital Ocean. I used boghop.com to learn about AWS services.


### Previous readme

In the spring of 2016, I created a web-based, static site generator app that I call Wren.

The Wren test site is located at <http://wren.soupmode.com>.

I use Wren to manage <http://birdbrainsbrewing.com>, although we have not brewed beer in a long while.

In the fall of 2016, I created yet another personal website at <http://boghop.com> that is managed by Wren. 

I created Boghop to be the ultimate home for all of my scattered web postings that I have made since 2001, which numbers into the thousands of posts.

I also wanted to use Boghop to test Amazon's Web Services. At Boghop, I use Route 53, EC2, S3, and CloudFront.

I modified the Wren version that's used at Boghop, and the code is stored here.
