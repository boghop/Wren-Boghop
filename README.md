# Wren-Boghop

In the spring of 2016, I created a web-based, static site generator app that I call Wren.

The Wren test site is located at <http://wren.soupmode.com>.

I use Wren to manage <http://birdbrainsbrewing.com>, although we have not brewed beer in a long while.

In the fall of 2016, I created yet another personal website at <http://boghop.com> that is managed by Wren. 

I created Boghop to be the ultimate home for all of my scattered web postings that I have made since 2001, which numbers into the thousands of posts.

I also wanted to use Boghop to test Amazon's Web Services. At Boghop, I use Route 53, EC2, S3, and CloudFront.

I modified the Wren version that's used at Boghop, and the code is stored here.
